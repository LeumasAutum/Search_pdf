# Search_pdf
Search through Pdfs in a folder.
This program creates a GUI using the tkinter library. It includes a label and an entry field for the search string, a search button, and a listbox to display the search results. The listbox items are made clickable, and double-clicking on an item opens the corresponding PDF file with the system viewer.

Please note that the program relies on the PyPDF2 library, which may not work with some PDF files that contain advanced features. You may need to install the library using pip install PyPDF2 if you don't have it installed already.
